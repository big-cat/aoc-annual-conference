These places are strictly limited and are allocated on a first-come first-served basis. If delegates are unable to attend the gala dinner or should the gala dinner be full at the time of booking they will not be entitled to a reduction in the price of the full conference package due to the substantial discount already applied to the full conference package.

The same delegate must attend the full conference package including the gala dinner.</p><p>If you have not received confirmation and/or final information 10 days prior to the conference, please contact the conference office on 020 7034 9934. AoC Create cannot be held for responsible for non-arrival of information.</p><h3>Cancellations with Multiple Delegate Discounts</h3><p>If you decide to cancel your attendance at the conference and you have paid a discounted conference fee, the cancellation fees as outlined in the cancellation policy will be applied to this discounted conference fee (i.e. the multiple delegate discounted fee).
        </p><p>Please note, in order to receive the relevant discounts, there must always be a full fee paying delegate as discounts only apply to the second and subsequent bookings. If this full fee booking is cancelled, a discounted delegate fee will be amended back to the full fee amount to reflect this.
        </p><h3>Ofsted Inspection </h3><p>If you need to cancel your booking due to an Ofsted Inspection taking place on, during or in the week immediately following the week of the conference, we will refund 100% of the conference fee on the condition that we receive notification in writing, together with a copy of the Ofsted letter, sent to annualconference@aoc.co.uk prior to the date of the conference.
