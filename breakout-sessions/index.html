        <h2 class="h2">What are they?</h2>
        <p>Breakout sessions are always a key part of the conference and we would like to invite you to submit session proposals which will form part of the overall programme. This is your opportunity to deliver one of the 60 minute sessions. </p>
        <p>Do you have something to share with the FE Sector? Has your organisation implemented something innovative that can re-shape the studentsâ€™ experience? Do you have a case study of best practice or have you developed new and impactful strategies that our audience will benefit from hearing?
        If you answer yes to any of these questions, make sure you submit a proposal by Friday 12 August. </p>
        <p class="m-b--n">Please read the hints and tips carefully before you put forward your ideas.</p>
